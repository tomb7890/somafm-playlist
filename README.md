Somafm-Playlist
===============


#### What is this thing?

This thing extracts the direct stream links from all channels, and writes them to a M3U file.

#### Why did you make it?

I like listening to streaming music with alternatives to the standard
pop up player.

#### How do you use it?

Just run rake after you clone, which produces a new `~/Music/somafm.m3u`.

#### What if I prefer a different filename?

Make the change to the filename variable in somafm.rb.
